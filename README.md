## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

Additionally, below JSON files contained in the data folder are needed to runt the code 
- portfolio.json - containing offer ids and metadata about each offer (duration, type, etc.)
- profile.json - demographic data for each customer
- transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I have used the data available supplied b Starbucks for the Udacity Capstone Challenge:
After some Analysing the data and you can have insight as well if you look into the Dataset part of the notebook.

I have decided to find answers to the below question:
1. What are the successful offers based on types based on different demographics (age, gender, income)
2. There s specefic group were they complete offers without knowing about them, what are the key characteristics for them?
3. Is there a specefic channel type that affects the success of the offer (Quantity Vs quality)


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
This repository contains analysis for the Starbucks Capstone Challenge.
Main file to run is (Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynp) a Jupyter notebook to go over the anlysis and results genrated. 
Other files are the datasets used in the notebook
